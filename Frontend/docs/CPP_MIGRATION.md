# Native frontend migration relay

## Baseline and scope

Python remains the authoritative runtime/reference at main commit
`e742fb7ab85ba0c571d50e45ff0a410eb2a444dd`. Branch:
`frontend/cpp-migration-foundation`. This relay covers **0A + 0B only**:
compatibility fixtures, representation, exact encoders, SHA-256, standalone core,
CLI shell and native tests. No frontend backend operation is ported or exposed.
No engine, Menu, legacy disk format, schema version, or Python behavior changes.

## Immutable compatibility contract

* Read manifest versions 1/2, history and receipt version 1, journal versions
  1–4; never upgrade on read. Preserve unknown nested metadata and exact JSON
  value kinds. Exact-integer validation must reject booleans and floats even
  though Python numeric equality considers `True == 1 == 1.0`.
* Preserve exact authority and current head, with no fallback to earlier state.
  Retain native bytes and historical codec-helper pins; do not re-encode saves.
* Keep POSIX/NT path semantics distinct. Preserve Latin-1 projection and case
  ambiguity rules. Reject unsafe links, aliases, reparse points, hardlinks,
  special files and overlapping owned paths; keep capture bounded and stable.
* Source, baseline, working and returned evidence are independent. Signal only
  an owned live child, never a PID recovered from a journal. Preserve timeouts,
  cancellation, bounded retained logs and draining of child output.
* Distinguish unknown/null evidence from an observed empty list. A candidate
  is not quarantine and neither authorizes automatic adoption.
* Acceptance is explicit and freshly revalidated against the expected
  predecessor and candidate digest. Publish an independent immutable snapshot
  before the atomic head + receipt commit. A copy failure after that commit
  must not roll back authority. Reject stale and equal-byte competing sessions.
  An idempotent retry must never rewind G2 to G1.

### Exact serialization and hashes

`ContentFingerprintV1` is the byte encoding in `lodge.discovery.fingerprint`:
`json.dumps(sorted(entries), ensure_ascii=True, separators=(',', ':')).encode()`.
Each entry is `[relative-posix-path, integer-size, member-sha256]`. Hash those
bytes with SHA-256, lowercase hexadecimal; no newline, no spaces, no object or
algorithm wrapper. The native encoder receives already observed entries; it
does not scan or validate filesystem content.

`JournalEvidenceV1` is `lodge.session_io.encode(decoded_value)`:
`(json.dumps(value, indent=2, sort_keys=True, allow_nan=False) + '\n').encode()`.
`lodge.acceptance.candidate_digest` hashes **those encoded bytes**, not original
disk bytes. Object ordering, whitespace and numeric source spelling are not
retained on disk-byte evidence; decoded kinds and values are retained. This
encoder is not journal validation or acceptance.

Strings sort by Unicode code point, not UTF-8 bytes or UTF-16 code units.
ASCII output uses lowercase `\\u` escapes, surrogate pairs for supplementary
code points, short escapes for backspace/formfeed/newline/carriage-return/tab,
and escaped quote/backslash; slash is not escaped. Escaped unpaired surrogates
are valid retained Python strings. Raw UTF-8 must be well formed. Duplicate
object keys are rejected after escape decoding at every depth, including an
escaped key identical to a literal key. No Unicode normalization is performed.

Integers retain arbitrary decimal magnitude rather than narrowing to binary64
or int64; negative integer zero becomes `0`. Floats remain IEEE-754 binary64,
including signed zero: `900.0` remains `900.0`, `-0.0` remains `-0.0`. Use the
shortest round-tripping nearest decimal, fixed notation for decimal exponents
from -4 through 15, and signed exponent notation with at least two exponent
digits otherwise. Preserve `.0` for fixed integral floats. Nonfinite tokens
(`NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`) and overflow are accepted by Python decoding,
but rejected by `JournalEvidenceV1` exactly as `allow_nan=False` requires.
Underflow rounds to signed zero. Retaining nonfinite unknown metadata at parse
time is separate from permission to encode evidence.

The private representation has no public semantic equality operation. Future
validation must reproduce Python numeric equality where used by the reference,
and exact-type checks where used, rather than replace both with one DOM rule.
Python's configurable integer digit and recursion resource limits are not new
file-format semantics. Resource/stack limits and all accepted representation
differences must be resolved as migration gates before exposing read APIs;
they do not authorize tightening the Python contract.

### Oracle and verification

`python3 Frontend/tools/generate_compatibility.py --check` regenerates in memory
using unchanged Python code and compares the committed corpus byte for byte.
Run without `--check` only for a reviewed oracle update. The generator calls the
real journal encoder and candidate digest, and captures the real fingerprint
payload over tiny authored files. No game assets are used. Inputs include
unknown metadata, duplicates, type distinctions, numeric boundaries, fixed
binary64 samples and Unicode cases. Expected payloads are stored as hex so LF,
escaping and indentation are reviewable independently of checkout line endings.

## Evidence and remaining gates

The published prerequisite 0A commit is
`ac92f8a153313c25e1fd7cfc6fce66651ca74a0f` (tree
`a8e52dae0fb398e7ce3f47e3f9d550f0d70a3e59`). This following 0B commit contains
the implementation, expanded 325-case corpus, and these results. Its SHA must
be recorded by the coordinator in review/merge evidence, not guessed within
its own content. Both slices await independent review; none is self-approved.

The standalone `c2_frontend_core` is C++17. Its public header exposes only
version and in-memory SHA-256; the DOM and named encoders are private/test
interfaces. `c2-frontend-native` exposes only help/version and rejects backend
commands. The existing Python `c2-frontend` target and all existing assertions
remain intact. Dependencies are vendored, pinned and offline; see
`native/third_party/README.md` for exact provenance, hashes, license and review.
The existing Linux/Windows frontend workflow already builds all targets and
runs all CTests, so its gates did not need modification.

Local validation: GNU C++ 13.3.0, Python 3.12.14, CMake 4.4.3, Ninja 1.13.2,
Linux x86-64. Commands from repository root (build directories may be outside
the checkout):

```sh
python3 Frontend/tools/generate_compatibility.py --check
cmake -S Frontend -B build/frontend-debug -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build/frontend-debug --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build/frontend-debug --output-on-failure --no-tests=error

cmake -S Frontend -B build/frontend-release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/frontend-release --target c2-frontend-native-tests c2-frontend-native --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build/frontend-release -R 'frontend-(native|compatibility)' --output-on-failure --no-tests=error

cmake -S Frontend -B build/frontend-sanitized -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  '-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer' \
  '-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fsanitize=address,undefined'
cmake --build build/frontend-sanitized --target c2-frontend-native-tests c2-frontend-native --parallel 2
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 UBSAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1 \
  ctest --test-dir build/frontend-sanitized -R 'frontend-(native|compatibility)' --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
```

Results: Debug 6/6 CTests passed, including the unchanged 154-test Python suite
(69.27 seconds total); the final expanded corpus then passed all 5 foundation
CTests again (0.75 seconds). Release 5/5 passed (0.40 seconds), ASan/UBSan 5/5
passed (1.82 seconds), oracle `--check` passed. The coordinator independently
ran the unchanged baseline Python suite: 154 tests passed. Initial local
verification had a transient missing build executable and a mistakenly
overlapping clean rebuild/test run; the stable rerun above supersedes those
infrastructure failures. LeakSanitizer fails under this environment's ptrace
and was disabled; address and undefined-behavior checks remained enabled.

Preliminary coordinator evidence (before final published-SHA review): 50,986
independent differential cases had zero mismatches against unchanged Python,
including 20,000 random binary64 values, 20,000 long decimal/exponent spellings,
1,000 nested Unicode/large-integer objects, and 10,000 malformed-byte mutations.
The coordinator also independently compared both vendored PicoSHA2 files
byte-for-byte against the pinned upstream commit: exact matches. Complete
published-commit code review and CI remain pending.

Native tests compare every oracle byte/digest, preserve nested unknown fields,
check duplicate keys and exact types, and exercise escaping, invalid UTF-8,
binary64 boundaries, large integers, deep containers, SHA known answers and
locale independence. Test-only differential drivers accept arbitrary UTF-8 on
stdin via `c2-frontend-native-tests --journal-stdin` or `--compact-stdin`.

Real gates: the JSON grammar/DOM implementation is original and requires
independent review; a finite corpus cannot prove equivalence. It uses decimal
strings and code points without integer/Unicode loss and C++17 `charconv` for
binary64. Parsing/encoding currently guards depth above 1000, covering the
baseline default CPython recursion budget; deeper input accepted under an
explicitly increased Python recursion limit remains a resource-policy gate
before any production read API/cutover. Native decimal storage does not impose
Python's configurable integer conversion digit limit. These are explicit
resource-policy differences, never permission to change accepted file data.
Domain validation, Python-compatible semantic equality, filesystem policy,
processes and every later relay slice remain unimplemented.

Windows MSVC CI is required before merge; local Linux validation cannot stand
in for it. No later slice should start until 0A/0B representation gates pass.

## Review correction: bounded native stack use

The coordinator inspected published head
`42c2e0880134438a771e8b26ffc601ad691328bf`: 0 commits behind / 2 ahead of the
baseline, the complete 14-file additive diff, and no weakened existing tests.
An isolated Linux Debug run passed 6/6 CTests in 71.95 seconds; the independent
50,986-case differential rerun again had zero mismatches. That evidence did
**not** clear the Windows gate: MSVC compiled successfully, but native
compatibility crashed with a segmentation fault in job `106048568361`, push
run `35499486506`. The other five CTests, including all 154 Python tests, passed.

The original recursive parser exhausted its native call stack before safely
rejecting the existing 1002-opening-bracket test. An isolated reproduction of
that exact input with the original source, ASan and a 512 KiB child-process
stack reported `stack-overflow` with repeated `Parser::value` frames. GCC with
a larger/noninstrumented stack could pass; that did not establish Windows
safety. With the correction, the same reproducer returns the intended
`JSON nesting resource limit` error without overflowing.

Parser and encoder traversal now use explicit heap frames. DOM copy traverses
an explicit work list, and moves transfer ownership without recursive copies.
Destruction walks ownership in postorder using temporary parent pointers;
it allocates nothing and only destroys already-empty child containers. Thus
ordinary destruction, replacement, partially built trees and exception unwind
do not consume call stack proportional to document depth. The private DOM's
value/copy semantics, original depth-above-1000 guard, all 325 golden cases,
Unicode/numeric behavior, evidence bytes and public API remain unchanged.

Regression coverage includes arrays and objects with a scalar at depth 1000,
the accepted empty-container boundary, deep copy/move/replacement/destruction,
near-limit incomplete documents, well-formed and malformed over-limit input,
and encoder rejection of privately constructed over-limit trees. The original
1002-bracket assertion remains. Native test stage messages locate future CI
failures. A new `frontend-native-stack` CTest runs owned children at 256 KiB on
POSIX and the unchanged executable default stack on Windows. No `/STACK`
override or reduction in nesting coverage is used. Rejections must return
the normal error exit and message; crashes cannot satisfy the test.

The stack regression also compares deep journal bytes to unchanged Python:
depth 900 is accepted with its default recursion budget; for depth 1000 the
test temporarily increases only the oracle process's recursion budget to
compare the native guard boundary's bytes. This does not change reference
runtime code or erase the documented configurable-resource gate. Windows
test-only stdin/stdout are explicitly binary so subprocess comparisons check
the actual LF evidence, without newline normalization.

Correction validation uses the build/test commands above, with a fresh Debug
build outside workspace binary synchronization and the added stack CTest.
The exact final full-suite command was:

```sh
cmake -S Frontend -B /tmp/c2-foundation-stackfix-debug -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build /tmp/c2-foundation-stackfix-debug --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir /tmp/c2-foundation-stackfix-debug --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
```

Debug passed all 7 CTests, including all unchanged 154 Python tests (68.87
seconds total). Release passed all 6 foundation CTests (1.54 seconds), and
ASan/UBSan passed all 6 (4.87 seconds), including the constrained-stack children.
The original 325-case oracle `--check` still passes. Earlier workspace builds
encountered executables being truncated during synchronization, independently
observed by the coordinator; the fresh `/tmp` build avoided that infrastructure
failure. Windows rerun and final correction review remain required before merge
or later slices; the correction commit's SHA belongs in subsequent evidence.
